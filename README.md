# CSE412-Book-Management-System

## About The Project
This is a web-based application offers the service of searching book information, renting books, and sharing comments.
This repository contains the full stack application and complete source codes. We also offer the database dump so you can build the local database with PostgreSQL.
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate our understanding of modern databases and our ability to apply them in practice after learning in CSE412 with Dr.Jia Zou during Fall 2021.
